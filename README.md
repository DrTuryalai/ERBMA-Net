# ERBMA-Net-for-facial-depression-recognition
This repository contains the implementation of Enhanced Random Binary Multilevel Attention Network (ERBMA-Net), a novel framework for facial depression recognition. ERBMA-Net addresses key limitations in existing methods by introducing random binary convolutional filters for enhanced adaptability and multilevel attention mechanisms.
