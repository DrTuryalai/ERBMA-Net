# ERBMA-Net: Enhanced Random Binary Multilevel Attention Network for facial depression recognition
This repository contains the implementation of Enhanced Random Binary Multilevel Attention Network (ERBMA-Net), a novel framework for facial depression recognition. ERBMA-Net addresses key limitations in existing methods by introducing random binary convolutional filters for enhanced adaptability and multilevel attention mechanisms to effectively capture both local and global patterns in facial expressions.

# Key Features
Multi-branch Architecture: Extracts global (face) and local (eyes, mouth) features for comprehensive facial analysis.
Enhanced Random Binary Convolutional Neural Network (ERBCNN): Introduces random binary filters and a refinement layer to improve feature processing over traditional LBCNN.
Multilevel Attention Mechanisms: Includes spatial attention for independent feature refinement and self-attention for modeling long-range dependencies.
High Performance: Achieves state-of-the-art results on two datasets:
AVEC2014: MAE = 6.80, RMSE = 8.18
CZ2024: MAE = 6.37, RMSE = 8.08
